I'm Kyle Haptonstall, a senior Computer Science major at Monmouth College. I'll use my blog to record my projects throughout college, my journey to find a job, and all my research and other hobbies in between.

##Current Projects	

####Can't Stop AI
As a NSF Research Fellow at the University of Maryland, my project consists of creating multiple AI's that can take on 
and hopefully beat a human player in the board game [Can't Stop][cant-stop-wiki]. The project is coded entirely in C++
and uses several different methods of playing, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search or mathematical dice rolling probabilities. The
project can be found [here][cant-stop-github].


####SigEp IL Gamma iOS App
One of the challenges that face campus greek life recruiting is not only getting information about events
out to potential new members, but also about bringing those individuals to your events so you can build a connection. 
With so much of our information coming from our mobile devices, it is surprising that no one on campus is taking advantage of
the mobile app industry in terms of recruiting. I'm currently using Swift along with libraries such as JSQMessages, Google Calendar, 
ParseSDK, and FacebookSDK to build an app that will make events and information more easily accessible and help in recruiting efforts.
