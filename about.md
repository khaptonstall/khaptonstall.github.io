My name is Kyle Haptonstall, a junior Computer Science major attending Monmouth College, a small liberal arts school in the Midwest. When my time is not being ate up by my class schedule, I like to spend time in philanthropic effots with my fraternity brothers, develop iOS apps, and spend time soaking up the sun.
