My name is Kyle Haptonstall, a junior Computer Science major attending Monmouth College, a small liberal arts school in the Midwest. When my time is not being ate up by my class schedule, I like to spend my time in philanthropic efforts with my fraternity brothers, developing iOS apps, and soaking up the sun.
