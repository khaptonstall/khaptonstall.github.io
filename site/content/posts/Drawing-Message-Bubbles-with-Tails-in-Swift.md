A common theme in messaging apps is to have a message bubble with a tail â€” itâ€™s better than just a bunch of blocks stacked on top of each other and itâ€™s an easy way to distinguish who sent a particular message. Though at this point in your iOS development experience you may wonder how exactly these custom views are created, so in this post Iâ€™ll show you how to make your own!

Note: For this tutorial I have already prepared a project available on [Github](https://github.com/khaptonstall/ios-message-bubble-demo) which has dynamically sized `UITableViewCell`'s setup. This is written in Swift 3 using Xcode 8.3.3.

Bezier Paths to the Rescue
==========================

Creating a square message cell isnâ€™t difficult, even one with rounded corners isnâ€™t too bad, but youâ€™ll have to change up the way you normally create cells in order to add a tail at the bottom of your messages. Below Iâ€™ll take you through the steps to not only draw a tail below your message cells, but also having it draw to the left or right based on who is sending the message, similar to iMessage.

In order to achieve our final result weâ€™ll need to draw the shape of the message bubble using a `[UIBezierPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibezierpath)` and then fill it in with our desired color. It may seem daunting at first, but think of it just like drawing a square on a piece of paper. You start at a given point, think (0,0), and begin drawing your first line to the next point, (1,0). Three more sides later and youâ€™re back at your starting point, ready to _close_ off your shape and _fill_ it in. Now we just have to do the same thing in code!

Drawing the Message Body
========================

Hop into the class`MessageBubbleView` and letâ€™s begin writing our code in `draw(_ rect)`. (Remove the call the `super.drawRect` as we will be providing our own drawing code.) Now we can begin our path with the following code:

```swift
let bezierPath = UIBezierPath()
bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.minY))
```

Think of `move` as code for picking up your pencil and placing it at a given point. This will be the starting point of our message bubble. Now weâ€™re going to draw the top line.

```swift
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.minY))
```

This will draw a line to the far right edge of the rect, which is the `maxX`. Now we can follow the same logic to draw the other three edges.

```swift
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.minY))
```

Now you might wonder why Iâ€™m not drawing my line all the way down to the bottom edge of the rect, or `maxY`. This is because Iâ€™m leaving a 10.0 point space for drawing our tail. I encourage to adjust these values and see what the different outcomes are in your own code!

Drawing the Tail
================

Now to add the tail. Weâ€™ll make use of the `move` function again here. Just as you would pick up your pencil from the top left edge of the rect (where we just ended our last line) and move it to the starting point for the tail. In this example Iâ€™m going to draw a tail that points down and to the right, and then draw a flat edge that comes back up and meets our message body.

```swift
bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 25.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
```

We have our shape! But if you run the code you will notice that you canâ€™t see it. This is because we need to close our path and fill it in.

```swift
UIColor.lightGray.setFill()
bezierPath.fill()
bezierPath.close()
```

Great! We close out our path and fill it with a light gray color. Now our `draw` method should look like this:

```swift
override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
let bezierPath = UIBezierPath()//Draw main body
bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.minY))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.minY))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX, y: rect.minY))//Draw the tail
bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 25.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))UIColor.lightGray.setFill()
bezierPath.fill()
bezierPath.close()
}
```

Build and run the project and you should have the following result:

Shifting the Tail
=================

This is looking good! Now it would be nice if the tail shifted based on who sent the message. To do this weâ€™re going to setup a variable on our `MessageBubbleView` that acts as a flag to determine where to position the tail.

```swift
var currentUserIsSender = true {
    didSet {
        setNeedsDisplay()
    }
}
```

Now we have a public property called `currentUserIsSender` which defaults to `true`. Using Swiftâ€™s `didSet` allows us to notify the view that it needs to redraw itself after this property has changed by calling `setNeedsDisplay`. Now in our `draw` method we can adjust the tail based on this value.

```swift
if currentUserIsSender {
    bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 25.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
    bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY))
    bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.maxX - 10.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
} else {
    //Draw the tail on the left
}
```

Here I just moved the current tail drawing code into an `if/else` statement based on our flag we setup. Now we just have to add the code to draw the tail on the left hand side. All that needs to be done is, instead of starting at the `maxX` we start at `minX` like so:

```swift
bezierPath.move(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX + 25.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX + 10.0, y: rect.maxY))
bezierPath.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: rect.minX + 10.0, y: rect.maxY - 10.0))
```

Now letâ€™s add a way to update the `currentUserIsSender` flag. Add a new property to the `configure` method in `MessageTableViewCell`:

```swift
func configure(withMessage message: String, currentUserIsSender: Bool) {
    messageLabel.text = message
    messageContainerView.currentUserIsSender = currentUserIsSender
}
```

Then we can add some logic to switch that flag every other message in our `cellForRow` method:

```swift
let currentUserIsSender = indexPath.row % 2 == 0
cell.configure(withMessage: message, currentUserIsSender: currentUserIsSender)
```

Alright, now we have a tail that will alternative based who sent the message! Go ahead and build and run the project to see the results.

Awesome! ðŸŽ‰

Now youâ€™re up an running with `UIBezierPath`'s! Thereâ€™s so much more you can do now and I encourage you to experiement even further with the project! It may even be easier to draw your idea out on paper and then translate that into code.

Some ideas that you can play around with are:

*   Alternate the color of the message based on who sent it
*   Adjust the shape and position of the tail
*   Adjust the text alignment based on who sent the message

In the future I plan to extend this project with further examples. Until then, play around with the current project, and you can also find the finished project by checking out the `finished-project` branch from my [Github repo](https://github.com/khaptonstall/ios-message-bubble-demo).
