A colleague recently asked how I stay up-to-date with all the new changes constantly being released by Apple and the Swift team. After realizing the answer wasn’t so simple, I figured I’d finally document it!

Below are all the resources and tools *I* use to stay informed, and hopefully you’ll find value in them too.

# WWDC

If nothing else, I highly recommend every iOS engineer dedicate time to watch some of Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference. Granted, there are *a lot* of sessions available, but here’s what I’d consider the essentials:

- Keynote

- Platforms State of the Union

- What’s new in Swift

- What’s new in SwiftUI

- What’s new in Xcode

- What’s new in Privacy

- Other relevant “What’s new in…” sessions depending on your app(s)



You can find past sessions at [Apple Developer Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/).

  - With an RSS Feed available, this is a great way to now when a new version of Xcode has dropped and see what’s new

# Curating a Social Feed

A lot of folks in the iOS community don’t write up longer form blog posts that often, however there’s a ton of great discussion happening across sites like Mastodon. Whether you want to participate or just lurk, it’s a great place to discover valuable nuggets of information.

To begin building a list of people to follow, you can start by finding your favorite:
