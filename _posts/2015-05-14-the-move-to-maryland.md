This summer I'm excited to have been accepted to the [University of Maryland REU][MarylandREU] on Combinatorial Algorithms Applied Research. This will be my second REU, my last being at the University of North Texas focusing on testing Android systems. 

An REU (Research Experience for Undergrads) is an NSF funded research program that allows undergraduates in the STEM fields to explore new areas of research at universities across the country.

This summer I will get the chance to expand my knowledge of artificial intelligence and algorithms. My group will be specifically focusing on algorithms in relation to the [Can't Stop Game.][Cant-Stop]

As my REU begins I will try to keep weekly blog posts with updates on my research.

Until then
